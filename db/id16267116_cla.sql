Human Beings are living forms, broadly categorized into two types, Male and Female. Right? Its true. Every Human being(Male or Female) has two legs, two hands, two eyes, one nose, one heart etc. There are body parts that are common for Male and Female, but then there are some specific body parts, present in a Male which are not present in a Female, and some body parts present in Female but not in Males.</p>\r\n<p>All Human Beings walk, eat, see, talk, hear etc. Now again, both Male and Female, performs some common functions, but there are some specifics to both, which is not valid for the other. For example : A Female can give birth, while a Male cannot, so this is only for the Female.</p>\r\n<p>Human Anatomy is interesting, isn\'t it? But let\'s see how all this is related to C++ and OOPS. Here we will try to explain all the OOPS concepts through this example and later we will have the technical definitons for all this.</p>\r\n<BR>', '<h3>Class</h3>\r\n<p>Here we can take <b>Human Being</b> as a class. A class is a blueprint for any functional entity which defines its properties and its functions. Like Human Being, having body parts, and performing various actions.</p>\r\n<HR>\r\n<h3>Inheritance</h3>\r\n<p>Considering <code>HumanBeing</code> a class, which has properties like hands, legs, eyes etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see etc. <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> are also classes, but most of the properties and functions are included in <code>HumanBeing</code>, hence they can inherit everything from class <code>HumanBeing</code> using the concept of <b>Inheritance</b>.</p>\r\n<HR>\r\n<h3>Objects</h3>\r\n<p>My name is Abhishek, and I am an <b>instance/object</b> of class <code>Male</code>. When we say, Human Being, Male or Female, we just mean a kind, you, your friend, me we are the forms of these classes. We have a physical existence while a class is just a logical definition. We are the objects.</p>\r\n<HR>\r\n<h3>Abstraction</h3>\r\n<p>Abstraction means, showcasing only the required things to the outside world while hiding the details. Continuing our example, <b>Human Being\'s</b> can talk, walk, hear, eat, but the details are hidden from the outside world. We can take our skin as the Abstraction factor in our case, hiding the inside mechanism.</p>\r\n<HR>\r\n<h3>Encapsulation</h3>\r\n<p>This concept is a little tricky to explain with our example. Our Legs are binded to help us walk. Our hands, help us hold things. This binding of the properties to functions is called Encapsulation.</p>\r\n<HR>\r\n<h3>Polymorphism</h3>\r\n<p>Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts using which it is done. Both the ways have different terms for them.</p>\r\n<p>If we walk using our hands, and not legs, here we will change the parts used to perform something. Hence this is called <b>Overloading</b>.</p>\r\n<p>And if there is a defined way of walking, but I wish to walk differently, but using my legs, like everyone else. Then I can walk like I want, this will be called as <b>Overriding</b>.</p>\r\n<HR>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'oops', NULL, NULL, NULL),

They are instances of class, which have data members and uses various member functions to perform tasks. </p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Class</h3><p>It is similar to structures in C language. Class can also be defined as user defined data type but it also contains functions in it.\r\nSo, class is basically a blueprint for object. It declare &amp; defines what data variables the object will have and what operations can be performed on the class\'s object. </p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Abstraction</h3><p>Abstraction refers to showing only the essential features of the application and hiding the details. In C++, classes can provide methods to the outside world to access &amp; use the data variables, keeping the variables hidden from direct access, or classes can even declare everything accessible to everyone, or maybe just to the classes inheriting it. This can be done using access specifiers.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Encapsulation</h3><p>It can also be said data binding. Encapsulation is all about binding the data variables and functions together in class.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Inheritance</h3><p>Inheritance is a way to reuse once written code again and again. The class which is inherited is called the <b>Base</b> class &amp; the class which inherits is called the <b>Derived</b> class. They are also called parent and child class.</p><p>So when, a derived class inherits a base class, the derived class can use all the functions which are defined in base class, hence making code reusable. </p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Polymorphism</h3><p>It is a feature, which lets us create functions with same name but different arguments, which will perform different actions. That means, functions with same name, but functioning in different ways. Or, it also allows us to redefine a function to provide it with a completely new definition. You will learn how to do this in details soon in coming lessons.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Exception Handling</h3><p>Exception handling is a feature of OOP, to handle unresolved exceptions or errors produced at runtime.</p>\r\n<hr><hr>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Objects\r\nClasses\r\nAbstraction\r\nEncapsulation\r\nInheritance\r\nOverloading\r\nException Handling\r\nPolymorphism', NULL, NULL, NULL),

Java can be easily extended as it is based on Object Model. Following are some basic concept of OOP\'s.</p>\r\n<ol class=\"content\" type=\"i\">\r\n<li>Object</li>\r\n<li>Class</li>\r\n<li>Inheritance</li>\r\n<li>Polymorphism</li>\r\n<li>Abstraction</li>\r\n<li>Encapsulation</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>3) Robust</h3>\r\n<p>Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic <b>Garbage Collector</b> and <b>Exception Handling</b>.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) Platform Independent</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike other programming languages such as C, C++ etc which are compiled into platform specific machines. Java is guaranteed to be write-once, run-anywhere language.</p>\r\n<p>On compilation Java program is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is platform independent and can be run on any machine, plus this bytecode format also provide security. Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>5) Secure</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to security, Java is always the first choice. With java secure features it enable us to develop virus free, temper free system. Java program always runs in Java runtime environment with almost null interaction with system OS, hence it is more secure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) Multi Threading</h3>\r\n<p>Java multithreading feature makes it possible to write program that can do many tasks simultaneously. Benefit of multithreading is that it utilizes same memory and other resources to execute multiple threads at the same time, like While typing, grammatical errors are checked along.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>7) Architectural Neutral</h3>\r\n<p>Compiler generates bytecodes, which have nothing to do with a particular computer architecture, hence a Java program is easy to intrepret on any machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>8) Portable</h3>\r\n<p>Java Byte code can be carried to any platform. No implementation dependent features. Everything related to storage is predefined, example: size of primitive data types\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>9) High Performance</h3>\r\n<p>Java is an interpreted language, so it will never be as fast as a compiled language like C or C++. But, Java enables high performance with the use of just-in-time compiler.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>10) Distributed</h3>\r\n<p>Java is also a distributed language. Programs can be designed to run on computer networks. Java has a special class library for communicating using TCP/IP protocols. Creating network connections is very much easy in Java as compared to C/C++.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Let\'s take a look at the features of Python.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Features of Python</h3>\r\n<ol class=\"content\">\r\n<li>It has simple easy-to-use syntax.</li>\r\n<li>It can run on almost any platform including Windows, Linux\'s all distros(All versions of Linux), Mac OS X, Unix etc.</li>\r\n<li>You can even combine the pieces of other programming languages like C, C++, etc with python to utilize the best of both worlds.</li>\r\n<li>It\'s large standard library support makes real life programming much easier. </li>\r\n<li>Other than that, it\'s open source, and have a huge community support working actively with Python programming.</li>\r\n<li>It\'s Object Oriented <b>(also called OO Programming or OOP)</b> which makes it more applicable to be used in real world application programming.</li>\r\n<li>Also, it can not only be used to write complex programs but can also be used to design applications with GUI(Graphical User Interface).</li>\r\n<li>Python is an Inerpreted language, as its the Interpreter which executes the python code line by line, which makes it easier to debug. But it is a topic of never ending discussion that is Python compiled? Well, technically it is, from user written code to <b>bytecode</b>, and the bytecode is then sent to the Interpreter to execute it. Here is a good StackOverflow discussion over this: <a class=\"show-in-android\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6889747/is-python-interpreted-or-compiled-or-both\" target=\"_blank\">Is Python interpreted, or compiled, or both?</a> </li>\r\n<li>Python has numerous implementations like <b>CPython</b>(The Standard implementation of python), <b>Jython</b>(Targeted for integration with java programming language) etc.</li>\r\n</ol>', '<u><h2>Applications of Python</h2></u>\r\n\r\n<p>One can say, you can do almost anything with Python.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"content\">\r\n<li><b>Web Application</b>: Python can be used to develop scalable and secure web applications. Frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid etc are amazing to design and develop web based applications.\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Computer Software or Desktop Applications</b>: As python can be used to develop GUI too, hence it is a great choice for developing desktop applications. <code>Tk</code> is an open source widget toolkit which can be used to develop desktop applications with python. <code>Kivy</code> is another such platform.\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Scientific Computing Application</b>: For its amazing computational power and simple syntax, python is used for scientific computing applications. Python libraries like <code>SciPy</code> and <code>NumPy</code> are best suited for scientific computations.\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>AI and ML(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)</b>: Python is at the fore front of the paradigm shift towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Image Processing</b>: Python is known for its image processing capabilities, which includes traversing and analysing any image pixel by pixel. There are numerous python libraries available for image processing, for example: Pillow, scikit-image etc.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with something that you might already be using: Websites like <b>Instagram</b>, <b>Reddit</b>, <b>Mozilla</b>, have been developed using Python. There are various web frameworks like <code>Django</code> (most popular one) and <code>Pyramid</code>, based on Python, which can be used to develop modern web applications.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2, 'Python Syntax Rules', '<ol class=\"content\">\r\n<li><b>Python is case sensitive</b>. Hence a variable with name <code>codelearningapplication</code> is not same as <code>CodeLearningApplication</code></li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li>For path specification, python uses <b>forward slashes</b>. Hence if you are working with a file, the default path for the file in case of Windows OS will have backward slashes, which you will have to convert to forward slashes to make them work in your python script.\r\n<p>For window\'s path <code>C:\\folderA\\folderB</code> relative python program path should be <code>C:/folderA/folderB</code></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li>In python, <b>there is no command terminator</b>, which means no semicolon <code>;</code> or anything.\r\n<p>So if you want to print something as output, all you have to do is:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Hello, World!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\r\n<p>Oops! we just shared the first python program too with you. Yes, just one single statement.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>In one line only a single executable statement should be written</b> and the line change act as command terminator in python.\r\n<p><b>To write two separate executable statements in a single line</b>, you should use a <b>semicolon</b> <code>;</code> to separate the commands. For example,</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Hello, World!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"This is second line\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<li>In python, you can use single quotes <code>\'\'</code>, double quotes <code>\"\"</code> and even triple quotes <code>\'\'\' \"\"\"</code> to represent string literals.\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\">word <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\'word\'</span>\r\nsentence <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"This is a one line sentence.\"</span>\r\npara <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token triple-quoted-string string\">\"\"\"This is a paragraph \r\nwhich has multiple lines\"\"\"</span></code></pre>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<li>In python, you can write <b>comments</b> in your program using a <code>#</code> at the start. A comment is ignored while the python script is executed.\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token comment\"># this is a comment</span>\r\n<span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Hello, World!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\r\n<span class=\"token comment\"># this is a </span>\r\n<span class=\"token comment\"># multiline comment</span></code></pre>\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Line Continuation</b>: To write a code in multiline without confusing the python interpreter, is by using a backslash <code>\\</code> at the end of each line to explicitly denote line continuation. For example,\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token builtin\">sum</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>  <span class=\"token number\">123</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> \\\r\n       <span class=\"token number\">456</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> \\\r\n       <span class=\"token number\">789</span></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>Expressions enclosed in <code>( )</code>, <code>[ ]</code> or <code>{ }</code> brackets don\'t need a backward slash for line continuation. For example,</p>\r\n<div><div class=\"center\" style=\"max-height:280px;\">\r\n\r\n<div data-ad=\"InContent\" id=\"Asc-InContent-hW1uY23\" data-sizes=\"[[1,1],[336,280],[300,250]]\" class=\"asc-ad\" data-google-query-id=\"COyZnMHjne8CFQ2bSwUdCxkKEg\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/54243763/studytonight_incontent_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/54243763/studytonight_incontent_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/54243763/studytonight_incontent_0\" width=\"336\" height=\"280\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" srcdoc=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-google-container-id=\"8\" data-load-complete=\"true\"></iframe></div></div>\r\n</div></div>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\">vowels <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\'a\'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\'e\'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\'i\'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\r\n          <span class=\"token string\">\'o\'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\'u\'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre>\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li>Blank lines in between a program are ignored by python.</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Code Indentation</b>: This is the most important rule of python programming. In programming language like Java, C or C++, generally curly brackets <code>{ }</code> are used to define a code block, but python doesn\'t use brackets, then how does python knows where a particular code block ends. Well python used indentation for this.\r\n<p>It is recommended to use <b>tab</b> for indentation, although you can use spaces for indentation as well, just keep in mind that the amount of indentation for a single code block should be same.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\r\n<span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Yes, I am in if block\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n<span class=\"token comment\"># the above statement will not be </span>\r\n<span class=\"token comment\"># considered inside the if block</span></code></pre>\r\n<p>the correct way would be,</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># this is inside if block </span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Yes, I am in if block\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\r\n<p>Also, the following code will give error, as the statements are differently indented:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># this is inside if block </span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Yes, I am in if block\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># this will give error</span>\r\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"me too\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\r\n<p>again, the correct way to do so is to keep all the statements of a particular code block at same indentation.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"python language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># this is inside if block </span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Yes, I am in if block\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"me too\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(3, 'python Numbers and built-in Math Functions', '<p>In this section, we will be learning about Numbers and various Math functions available in the python language. In Numbers, we will see some of the most commonly used math operators that we can use to perform various operations on the numbers in python. Under Math functions section, we will learn about some shortcuts (called <b>functions</b>), which are very helpful in calculating some of the complex mathematical expressions like <i>power</i>, <i>sine/cosine</i>, <i>factorials</i> etc. So, let\'s begin. We recommend keeping the IDLE open while reading so that you can practice and learn simultaneously.</p>\r\n', '<h2>Numbers</h2>\r\n<p>In Python we have 6 basic <b>mathematical operators</b>, they are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"content\">\r\n<li>Addition</li>\r\n<li>Subtraction</li>\r\n<li>Multiplication</li>\r\n<li>Division</li>\r\n<li>Modulo</li>\r\n<li>Power</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of you must be familiar with all of the above operators except for the <b>modulo</b> operator. Don\'t worry we will explain it. Let\'s start from the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n', '<h3>Addition</h3>\r\n<p>As you might have guessed it\'s just simple addition of numbers. In order to test the operator, just go to IDLE and type a number, then addition sign <code>+</code>, and then another number to add to the first number. Press <b>Enter</b>. This must look like this.</p>\r\n<code><p><b>Example:</b> Taking 8 and 19 as example,</p><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">+</span><span class=\"token number\">19</span>\r\n<span class=\"token number\">27</span></code></pre>\r\n</code>\r\n<p>On pressing <b>return</b>(or <i>enter</i>), the answer will appear just below the code line. And this is how the output will be displayed, all the time - <i>just below your code line</i>. As you\'ll hit the enter key, output will appear in the line below.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t stop with this example, try using the addition operator with other numbers. Try number with decimal places, like <code>4.5 + 5.5</code> and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subtraction</h3>\r\n<p>Just like addition, subtraction has the same syntax. Just change the operator to <code>-</code>. Again, pick some random numbers and try. </p>\r\n<code><p><b>Example:</b> We took <code>89.33</code> and <code>23.67</code>, which gave the output <code>65.55</code>.</p>\r\n</code>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Multiplication</h3>\r\n<p>Same again! Just change the operator to <code>*</code>, also known as an <b>asterisk</b>. You do know that it\'s used for multiplication, right? Go ahead and try it in you IDLE.</p>\r\n<code><p><b>Example:</b> Take any two numbers and multiply them using the * operator<code>*</code> .</p></code>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Division</h3>\r\n<p>Use <code>/</code> sign this time. And try with random numbers. <b>Caution:</b> If you\'re a beginner, you might find some difficulty in this one. How? Let\'s see. Let\'s take some integer numbers (numbers without decimal) like <code>16</code> and <code>2</code>, and divide them. </p>\r\n<code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span>\r\n<span class=\"token number\">8</span></code></pre></code>\r\n<p>Very well. Next, try with <code>15</code> and <code>2</code>. What do you expect the answer would be? Well, according to proper mathematics the answer should obviously be <code>7.5</code>, but if you actually try this in IDLE, the answer will turn out to be <code>7</code>. This happened, because if we perform any mathematical operation on an integers then the answer would be an integer. In our case, <code>15</code> and <code>2</code> both are integers, hence, our answer is <code>7</code>, as the answer has to be an integer.</p>\r\n<p>You might be wondering if it had to be an integer, why it turned out to be <code>7</code> and why not any other integer number. Well, that is because the answer is determined as the closest, smaller integer to the original answer. In our case, the original answer is <code>7.5</code>, thus the nearest integer to it is 7 and 8, and since we have to pick the smaller one; 7 is picked as the answer. In mathematics, it is also known as <code>floor</code> function (it\'s there in Python too).</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Power</h3>\r\n<p>This mathematical operator is not usually found in common programming languages. In fact, Python is the only language we know which does have an operator for this. In rest of the languages, they use some pre-defined functions (shortcut as we mentioned before) to calculate this. Getting to the point, just put two asterisks like <code>**</code> between any two numbers. Example, to calculate <code>2</code> to the power <code>10</code>, you have to write:</p>\r\n<code><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token operator\">**</span><span class=\"token number\">10</span>\r\n<span class=\"token number\">1024</span></code></code>\r\n<p>With that, we now know about all the commonly used mathematical operators of python. Now you can try to combine multiple operators and use them to form one expression. We will recommend using <b>brackets</b> so that python can understand what you want as the answer, i.e. instead of writing <code>2-9.0/2</code>, write <code>2-(9.0/2)</code>. Remember <b>BODMAS</b>, how a mathematical expression with multiple operators is solved in mathematics.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Modulo</h3>\r\n<p>Modulo operator is denoted by <code>%</code> percentage sign. If you are familiar with the computer programming world, chances are you already know this function. In case you don\'t, no need to worry. You know division, right? Then you know what <b>remainder</b> is, correct? This Modulo operator, when used with two <b>operands</b>, returns the <b>remainder</b> as the answer. Here are some quick examples.</p>\r\n<p><code>12%2 = 0</code>, since 2 perfectly divides 12.</p>\r\n<p><code>13%2 = 1</code>, since dividing 13 with 2 leaves 1 as remainder.</p>\r\n<p><code>19%5 = 4</code>, because, again, <code>19/5</code> leaves 4 as the remainder.</p>\r\n', '<h2>Math Functions in Python</h2>\r\n<p>As you learn more about python, you might decide to create a scientific calculator for a project or anything. For that, along with simple mathematical operations, you will have to evaluate some complex mathematical operations as well, like trigonometric operations, logarithmic operations, etc. Forget about the calculator, there can be various situations where you might need these functions. Like software for civil engineers to calculate various parameters of any structure that they are building, or any aerospace software - where they need various kinds of calculations about satellite trajectory, shuttle trajectory, and what not. In a nutshell, complex mathematical operations are used in various real-life programs and software, hence you must know about them.</p>\r\n<p>Now in Python, some nice guys have already created code pieces (libraries) for almost every mathematical function. We can use these codes without any hesitation and the plus point is, we won\'t have to re-write it again. Forget about rewriting, we don\'t even have to know what the complete code is. We only need a few key information to be able to use these readymade code pieces.</p>\r\n<p>Alright, so unofficially function part had already begun. We\'ll learn about functions in detail in a later chapter, thus we\'ll keep this one short.</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Function</b> can be described as a piece of code that may or may not take some value(s) as input, process it, and then finally may or may not return any value as output.</blockquote>\r\n<p>As you can see in the figure above, here input <code>x</code> is given to a function <code>f</code> and it is giving some value <code>f(x)</code> as the output. Although in the general programming world, depending upon the purpose of the function, input and output are completely optional. But for a mathematical function, it\'s very important to have both.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in the trigonometric function <code>sin(x)</code>, there must be some value of <code>x</code> in order to calculate and return the answer, and that pretty much establish why mathematical functions have both <b>input</b> and <b>output</b>.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>In python, there are two types of pre-defined functions.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"content\">\r\n<li><b>Inbuilt functions</b>: These are the functions which doesn\'t require any other(external) code file (known as, <b>Modules</b> or <b>Library Files</b>). These are a part of the Python core and are just built within the Python compiler hence there is no hassle of importing these modules/libraries in our code.</li>\r\n<li>The second type of function require some external files(modules) to be used. The process of using these external files in our code is called <b>importing</b>. So all we have to do is import the file into our code and use the functions which are already written in that file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once the python compiler has ensured that all the syntax (the grammar of programming) is correct, it will look for the implementation of the function <code>pow</code> and use it to find <code>3<sup>2</sup></code>. So as you might have expected, the output would be:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '<h3>Power - <code>pow(x,y)</code></h3>\r\n<p>I know what you might be thinking. <i>We just tried that, didn\'t we?</i> Well, we did saw something that can calculate power, but it was an <b>operator</b> and this one is an inbuilt function (yes, the first type). So, with that just consider this one as an alternative way to calculate power.</p>\r\n<p>Since this one is an inbuilt function, you don\'t need to import any other library files (or <b>modules</b>), hence it\'s pretty easy to implement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since power function will be needing two numbers(inputs) to perform the operation, i.e. <b>base</b> and <b>exponent</b>, hence we will have to provide two numbers to the function. Go ahead, open the IDLE and write:</p>\r\n\r\n<code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">pow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></code>\r\n<p>Now let\'s analyse what we did and what will happen. First, we wrote <code>pow</code>, which is simply the name of the function that we are trying to call. This will tell the python compiler to look out for an inbuilt function named <code>pow</code> and discover what it can do. Next, within the brackets we wrote two numbers separated with a comma, i.e. <code>3</code> and <code>2</code>. Here the first number <i>3 is base</i> and the second number <i>2 is an exponent</i>, and we are trying to calculate 3<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Absolute - <code>abs(x)</code></h3>\r\n<p>Absolute function, also known as <b>Modulus</b> (not to be confused with <b>Modulo</b>), returns the <b>non-negative</b> value of the argument value. Therefore, absolute value of any non-negative number is the same, while for negative numbers, their positive value is returned.</p>\r\n<p><b>Example:</b> absolute value of <code>-3</code> will be <code>3</code>, absolute value of <code>-8.74</code> will be <code>8.74</code> and so on.</p>\r\n<code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">abs</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">99.99</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">abs</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">99.99</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></code>\r\n<p>Since <code>-99.99</code> is a negative number, it\'s positive counterpart will be the output, i.e. <code>99.99</code>.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Sine - <code>sin(x)</code></h3>\r\n<p>Since we know <b>sine</b> is a trigonometric function, hence it accepts only one value as an argument, i.e. <code>x</code>. Here x should be in <b>radians</b>, so you better not confuse it with a <b>degree</b>. As we mentioned before we won\'t be able to use this function directly. If you do, you might get an error, something like this, which will say <b>name sin is not defined</b>.</p>\r\n<p>This is because the compiler doesn\'t know what it is supposed to do when it encounters <code>sin()</code> function, as we have not defined this function but we are trying to use it. So, in order to use it, we will have to import python\'s <b>math module</b> which consists the implementation of the <code>sin()</code> function, which will guide the python compiler to understand what to do when <code>sin()</code> is called.</p>\r\n<p>What we are about to do is called <b>importing a module</b> and it\'s most oftenly done to use already available <b>ready-made functions</b>. Importing a module takes just one extra line: </p>\r\n<code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> math</code></pre></code>\r\n<p>Hit enter, and you\'re done. Now in order to use the <code>sin()</code> function, go to a new line and type:</p>\r\n<code><pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\"><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">&gt;</span> math<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sin<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">3.14159</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></code><p>Since <code>3.14159</code> is approximately the value of <code>π</code> hence the answer would be near to zero.</p>\r\n<p>As you can see after <code>math.sin(3.14159)</code> statement, the answer returned was something like <code>2.653589335273e-6</code>, it might seem a little messy but it is an equivalent representation of <code>2.653589335273 × 10^-6</code>, or <code>0.000002653589335273</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Because of approximation in the value of <code>π</code>, the answer too just got deviated a little bit from 0, but you can see the value is almost zero. And at the same time, you can see how accurate the results are.</p>\r\n<p>Now of course there are several other functions available inside math module, like <code>floor()</code> (floor function; We mentioned this one in division operator), <code>exp()</code> (Exponential function), <code>log()</code> (Logarithmic function), <code>sqrt()</code> (Square root) and a lot more. You can check out the list, their syntax, number of arguments accepted and everything at Python\'s official website - Mathematical Functions. Python has a manual on their website where you can see all the functions listed with all the details.

(5, 'Variables in Python', '<p>This lesson deals with variables. Those who already know some programming must be familiar with the concept of variables and their importance. Variable are nameplates that we put on empty boxes(memory locations) in which we can store any value(data) and once we are done using a variable the nameplate is removed(going out of scope) from the box(memory location) which then can have a new nameplate. Also, in python one box can have multiple nameplates.</p>\r\n<p>In python everything is an object and <b>variables</b> are just names given to identify these objects.</p>\r\n', '<pre class=\" language-python\"><code class=\" language-python\">x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\r\ny <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span></code></pre>\r\n<p>Then for the object <code>10</code> we have two labels(references), <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>\r\n', '<p>Hence, we can say that variables provide a way of labelling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as nameplates for containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label the data stored in the memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s see some examples. A variable is supposed to have a <i>name</i>. There are some rules to assign a name to the variable.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"content\">\r\n<li>The variable name can consist of alphabet(s), number(s) and underscore(s) only.</li>\r\n<li>The first character in variable\'s name cannot be a number. Hence <code>i-am-variable</code>, <code>variable!</code>, <code>1variable</code>, <code>#variable</code>, are all invalid variable names. While <code>i_am_variable</code>, <code>variable</code>, <code>variable1</code>, <code>_variable</code>, are all valid names.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
